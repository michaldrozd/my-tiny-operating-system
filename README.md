# My custom tiny "operating systems" in C

## Repository

### `hello_world_os.c` - Hello World
I created very small Hello World "operating system", which prints this famous messages after booting system
It has its own printf implementation, so no dependency on any software!

### `show_disks_os.c` - Print all drives
This one is a bit more advanced C "OS", also printing all available disks based on BIOS interrupts
